# PostIt

PostIt supports collaboration and helps build relationships by allowing users create groups of other users. Broadcast messages can be sent to all members of these groups at the same time.

Different levels of priority can be set, so that users get notifications that betray the importance of the broadcast message.

## Feature List
PostIt allows you create an account(also available: sign in with Google!), create new broadcast groups, add your friends and colleagues to your groups. You can also send messages to everyone in a group, and messages have priorities too..
  ### critical (red)
    - sends email, sms and in app notifications
  ### urgent (yellow)
    - sends email and in app notifications
  ### normal (grey)
    - sends in app notifications
PostIt also allows you see who has read your message and archives messages you have read already.
